# Multithreaded-File-Server-with-Synchronization-for-Smartwatch-Data-Management
Implement a multithreaded file server that handles concurrent read/write requests from smartwatches, using mutexes for synchronization to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions. The server supports smartwatch functions like power-off commands, location tracking, and health data collection.
