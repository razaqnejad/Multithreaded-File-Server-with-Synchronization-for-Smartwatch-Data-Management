# Multithreaded-File-Server-with-Synchronization-for-Smartwatch-Data-Management
Develop and implement a multithreaded file server that efficiently handles simultaneous read and write requests from multiple clients, including smartwatches. The server will manage various smartwatch functions, such as sending power-off commands, finding lost watches, and receiving health data and location updates. Utilizing basic synchronization techniques like mutexes, the project aims to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency, providing a robust system for managing concurrent smartwatch communications and file operations.
